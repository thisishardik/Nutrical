# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/fitness_app/
    - images/NutriCal_logo.jpeg
    - assets/fonts/
    - images/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: AbrilFatface
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/AbrilFatface-Regular.ttf
    - family: Varela
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Varela.ttf
    - family: BebasNeue
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
